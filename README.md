There are three components that made up the notepad app operating system. Each app has its own functionalities.

The **Notepad** app is the major component of the software. That allows the user to edit text files and customize their own interfaces; features include changing text colors, font designs, and text sizes.

The **Recycle Bin** app keeps text files that are deleted and allows the user to recover them. Another feature that is currently being worked on is to permanently delete the items in the bin.

The **Computer** app contains directories that contain the text files the user creates. The app includes features such as opening and saving files from the Notepad app and deleting files.

Each app has its own window that simulates a software window that can be minimized, resized, or closed.
